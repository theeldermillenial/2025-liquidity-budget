### GOVERNANCE Protocol

#### Immutable Responsibilities

This section MAY NOT be modified by any future Info Actions, and any Info Action that attempts to modify the GOVERNANCE protocol that does not contain this section as it is stated will be considered invalid.

The administrating committee MUST follow ALL terms of this protocol. First and foremost, if an Info Action that aims to modify this protocol passes according to the criteria of Info Actions in the Cardano Constitution, the administrating committee MUST adopt all terms of the new protocol unless the Immutable Responsibilities section has been modified in any form. Changes to the protocol MAY include anything up to and including closure of the fund and/or changing the persons on the committee.

The committee MUST reject new protocols (even if they pass Info Action vote) if:
* It does not contain this section exactly as worded here
* An immutable link to the modified protocol is not included in the Info Action
* Changes would necessarily result in immediate loss of funds - for example if 4 of the committee members were requested for immediate removal without any replacements causing funds to be locked in the multi-signature wallet

Outside of these provisions, committee members MUST adopt any new protocol that passes an on chain Info Action vote.

#### Committee Composition

The committee MUST be composed of 7 members participating in a multisig (4 of 7) wallet. 4 members of the committee MUST be community members unaffiliated with founding entities, where affiliation with a founding entity is defined as having been employed by a founding entity within in the last 2 years. At most, each founding entity may have 1 committee seat. Founding entities are defined as Emurgo, Cardano Foundation, and Input Output Global.

#### Term Limits

Community members have a maximum term limit of 2 years, after which they can re-apply for a second 2 year term. A minimum of 4 community members (not affiliated with founding entities) must be on the committee at all times.

Founding entities may have at most 1 person each on the committee. There are no term limits for committee members that represent a founding entity, but must still abide by the removal process of an Info Action or a majority vote of the other committee members.

#### Retirement and Impeachment

In the event that a committee member retires or their signing keys are exposed, the remaining members of the committee must create a new multisig address with the same policy (4 of 7) that removes the retired address. This process also gives the committee the capacity to impeach inactive members of the committee, as well as the ability for the community to impeach one or more members through an info action.

#### Election

New committee members are elected by an Info Action. More than one person can be elected in an Info Action. The Info Action must include the name of the members to add and the name of the members to be removed from the committee.

#### Community Feedback

The administrating committee members should make themselves available to feedback and questions from the Cardano community, and make attempts to make changes that incorporate reasonable feedback from the community. Feedback can be received through a Telegram channel, on Twitter, and scheduled town hall meetings. The administrating committee should make attempts to incorporate feedback from the Cardano community, but are not obligated to do so. If the administrating committee does not respond or refuses to incorporate changes, the Cardano community may submit an on chain Info Action to modify this protocol to compel the committee to take an action.

#### Fund Composition

The goal of this budget is to increase fiat backed stablecoins. To briefly define terms:

* **Fiat back, Cardano native stablecoins** - Fiat backed Cardano native stablecoins are Cardano native stablecoins directly backed by treasury bills, money markets, etc.
* **Non-fiat backed, Cardano native stablecoins** - Cardano native stablecoins that are designed be pegged to USD but are not directly backed by fiat (i.e. CDP, algorithmic, etc)
* **Bridged stablecoins** - Stablecoins that represent a bridged asset.

With these definitions in mind, the liquidity fund should be composed as follows:
* ADA must make up 30% or less of deployed liquidity - this is intended to be paired with tokens on DEXs
* Non-fiat backed Cardano native stablecoins must make up 10% or less of deployed stablecoin liquidity
* Remainder of deployed liquidity must be fiat backed stablecoins

#### Reporting

The administrating committee MUST release a status report at least once each calendar month. Reports must include at a minimum total liquidity held by the administrating committee wallet, amount of deployed liquidity, amounts deployed to each protocol, total revenue generated, total sent to Cardano treasury, and total costs.

#### Stipend

The committee shall be paid $1000/month for work performed managing funds. Any committee member may choose to forego part or all of the stipend, and payments to each member should be documented in the monthly report. If the total fee revenue is less than the amount required to pay committee members, then committee members will receive at most the total value of fee revenue split between committee members. The committee MAY NOT withdrawal funds above what has been generated by fees to pay stipends.

#### Costs

For the budget period ending no later than August 2026, costs will be paid from initial funds withdrawn from the treasury. At the conclusion of the budget period, the fund is expected to be self sustaining and the montly budget is dependent on monthly revenue. If there are costs associated with maintaining the liquidity, these must be paid before paying committee members and may not exceed the total revenue generated for the month.

#### Treasury Revenue

The monthly report MUST indicate total revenue and costs. 15% of the total revenue minus costs must be sent back to the treasury and indicated in the monthly report. The other 85% should be capitalized.
