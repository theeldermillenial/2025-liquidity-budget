**Conflict of Interest Policy**  
*DeFi Stablecoin Liquidity Committee*

**Purpose**  
This policy ensures transparency and integrity in decisions made by the DeFi Stablecoin Liquidity Committee (“the Committee”). The Committee is responsible for evaluating and voting on liquidity provision to various DeFi protocols. Given the relatively small size of the Cardano DeFi ecosystem, it is recognized that Committee members may have affiliations with organizations that could directly or indirectly benefit from Committee actions.

**Disclosure Requirements**

1. Each Committee member must disclose any formal or informal affiliations with organizations, projects, or entities that could receive, or indirectly benefit from, liquidity provided under the Committee’s decisions.

2. Disclosures should include, but are not limited to:

   * Employment, advisory, or governance roles.

   * Token holdings, equity stakes, or other financial interests.

   * Partnerships, collaborations, or informal relationships that may influence impartiality.

3. Disclosures must be submitted to the Committee Chair (or designated administrator) and updated promptly if circumstances change.

4. Disclosures must be clearly made in any applications for liquidity. While the organization submitting the application is obligated to include the disclosure, it is incumbent on committee members to verify it is included.

**Recusal**

1. A member may voluntarily recuse themselves from voting on proposals where a potential conflict of interest exists.

2. The Committee Chair may also request that a member abstain from voting if a conflict is identified.

3. Recusals will be noted in meeting records for transparency.

**Transparency and Recordkeeping**

* A summary of disclosed interests will be maintained and made available to Committee members and, where appropriate, the broader community.

* The Committee aims to balance openness with privacy; sensitive information may be redacted where necessary.

**Commitment**  
All members agree to act in good faith, place the interests of the ecosystem above personal or affiliated interests, and uphold the principles of fairness and accountability in all Committee activities.
